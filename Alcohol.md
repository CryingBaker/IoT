To create an alcohol detection system using Arduino that activates a buzzer when alcohol is detected, you can use the **MQ-3** alcohol sensor. Below is a guide on the components required, circuit setup, and the Arduino code.

## Components Required

- **Arduino Uno** (or any compatible board)
- **MQ-3 Alcohol Sensor**
- **Buzzer**
- **Red LED** (optional for visual indication)
- **220-ohm resistor** (for the LED)
- **Breadboard**
- **Jumper wires**

## Circuit Setup

1. **Connect the MQ-3 Sensor**:
    - The MQ-3 sensor has four pins: VCC, GND, A0 (analog output), and D0 (digital output).
    - Connect the **VCC pin** to the 5V pin on the Arduino.
    - Connect the **GND pin** to the ground (GND) on the Arduino.
    - Connect the **A0 pin** to an analog pin on the Arduino (e.g., A0).
    - Optionally connect the **D0 pin** to a digital pin on the Arduino (e.g., pin 8) if you want to use digital output.
2. **Connect the Buzzer**:
    - Connect one terminal of the buzzer to a digital pin on the Arduino (e.g., pin 10).
    - Connect the other terminal of the buzzer to GND.
3. **Connect an LED** (optional):
    - Connect a red LED with its anode (longer leg) to a digital pin (e.g., pin 9) through a 220-ohm resistor.
    - Connect the cathode (shorter leg) of the LED to GND.

## Arduino Code

Here’s a sample code that reads from the MQ-3 sensor and activates a buzzer when alcohol is detected:
```cpp
#define MQ3pin A0      // Analog pin connected to MQ-3 sensor
#define buzzerPin 10   // Digital pin connected to buzzer
#define ledPin 9       // Digital pin connected to LED

void setup() {
    Serial.begin(9600);       // Start serial communication
    pinMode(buzzerPin, OUTPUT); // Set buzzer as output
    pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);     // Set LED as output
}

void loop() {
    int sensorValue = analogRead(MQ3pin); // Read analog value from MQ-3 sensor
    Serial.print("Sensor Value: ");
    Serial.println(sensorValue); // Print sensor value to Serial Monitor

    // Check if alcohol is detected based on threshold value
    if (sensorValue > 400) { // Adjust threshold based on calibration
        digitalWrite(buzzerPin, HIGH); // Turn on buzzer
        digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH);     // Turn on LED
    } else {
        digitalWrite(buzzerPin, LOW);  // Turn off buzzer
        digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW);      // Turn off LED
    }

    delay(1000); // Wait for 1 second before next reading
}
```
​
Explanation of Code
The code initializes serial communication and sets up pins for the buzzer and LED.
In loop(), it continuously reads the analog value from the MQ-3 sensor.
If the alcohol concentration exceeds a predefined threshold (400 in this case), it activates both the buzzer and LED. If not, both are turned off.
How to Use
Upload this code to your Arduino using the Arduino IDE.
Open the Serial Monitor (Ctrl + Shift + M) in the IDE to view real-time sensor readings.
When alcohol vapors are detected above the threshold, you will hear the buzzer sound and see the LED light up.
This setup provides a straightforward alcohol detection system using an Arduino and an MQ-3 sensor, suitable for various applications such as breathalyzers or safety devices. Adjustments can be made based on specific requirements or sensitivity levels.
VIVA

Here are the top 5 potential questions and answers that could be asked in a viva covering the concepts from the Arduino alcohol detection system code:

- **Q1: What is the purpose of the MQ-3 sensor in this project?**
A1: The MQ-3 sensor is used to detect alcohol vapors. It provides an analog output that corresponds to the concentration of alcohol in the air.
- **Q2: How does the code determine if alcohol is detected?**
A2: The code reads the analog value from the MQ-3 sensor and compares it to a predefined threshold (400 in this case). If the sensor value exceeds this threshold, it indicates that alcohol is detected.
- **Q3: What components are used in this alcohol detection system?**
A3: The main components used are an Arduino Uno (or compatible board), an MQ-3 Alcohol Sensor, a buzzer, and optionally a red LED for visual indication.
- **Q4: How is the buzzer activated when alcohol is detected?**
A4: When the sensor value exceeds the threshold, the code sets the buzzer pin to HIGH using `digitalWrite(buzzerPin, HIGH)`, which activates the buzzer.
- **Q5: How can the sensitivity of the alcohol detection be adjusted?**
A5: The sensitivity can be adjusted by modifying the threshold value in the code (currently set to 400). Lowering this value would make the system more sensitive, while increasing it would make it less sensitive.
